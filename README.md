Introduction
Data structures are fundamental building blocks in computer science. They enable efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. Understanding data structures is essential for solving complex problems and optimizing algorithms. This repository provides implementations and explanations of various data structures, including but not limited to arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

List of Data Structures
Here is a list of data structures covered in this repository:

Arrays: Static and dynamic arrays.
Linked Lists: Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
Stacks: Basic stack implementation.
Queues: Basic queue implementation, priority queues.
Trees: Binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, red-black trees, and heaps.
Graphs: Graph representations (adjacency matrix and adjacency list), graph traversal algorithms (DFS and BFS).
Each data structure folder contains the following:

Implementation code in various programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++).
Explanatory documentation and comments within the code.
Usage examples to help you understand how to use the data structure.
